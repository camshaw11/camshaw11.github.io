            <b>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</b><br><br>

            My ego can be quite high at times and I am becoming more self aware of this.
            I enjoy researching the psychology of how we learn and grow
            Putting your thoughts on paper can be a great way to relieve stress<br><br><br><br>
            
            <b>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</b><br><br>
            
            Having empathy for others is very important because it allows you to step into someone else's shoes and understand how 
            they are feeling. You can sense when something is wrong with someone and try to work with them to push through the problem 
            whether it be with coding or any issue they may have. <br><br>
            
            Being self-aware in learning and programming is a vital skill to have because it lets you recognize your own pitfalls and weaknesses 
            and is a great first step to seeking help. Self awareness lets you manage your emotions and helps you to question why you are feeling 
            a certain way.<br><br><br><br>
            
            
            <b>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</b><br><br>
            
            What surprised me is how much I actually enjoyed it. There was something quite freeing about putting my thoughts and feelings down on 
            paper. Setting goals and revisiting those goals forced myself to take in what I was learning and solidify the material in my brain.<br><br><br><br>
            
            
            <b>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</b><br><br>
            
            Like the answer above, the most challenging thing was figuring out how to articulate the thoughts inside my head.<br><br><br><br>
            
            
            <b>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</b><br><br>
            
            Because understanding yourself is a vital skill to have when working with people. Being present in the moment and being aware of what's 
            going on around you will help you succeed much further than just having good coding skills.<br><br><br><br>
            
            
            
            <b>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming 
            instead? Justify your answer.</b><br><br>
            
            It does not feel like a waste of time at all. Programming can be very mentally draining, especially as a beginner. We are humans, 
            not robots. We need to take a break from the technical side of things every now and then and actually talk to people. Communication 
            forms relationships.<br><br>
