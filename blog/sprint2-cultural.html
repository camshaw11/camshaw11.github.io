            <b>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</b><br><br>

            My long term career pathway is to become an accomplished Web Developer. I don’t want to be limited to just “Front-end” 
            or one single area. I want to have the chance to explore all sides of the tech industry. In 20 years the term “web developer” 
            might not even be pertinent anymore. But whatever “tech” is in 20 years I want to be at the forefront of it.<br><br>
            
            <b>What skills (non-technical) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</b><br><br>
            
            The skills in myself that I would like to see developed while at EDA are my mindset, and my leadership skills. I like that EDA
            exposes us to the idea of having a “growth mindset”. This is something I really want to see myself take on and push. The other 
            skill is leadership. I want to be able to motivate and enable others in my space to move forward.<br><br>
            
            <b>A description of your own strengths and limitations</b><br><br>
            
            One of the strengths I have is my self-awareness. I am usually quite aware of my surroundings and I try to work with how the 
            energy is around me. I think I can feel when people aren’t happy with something, or something is off. This also helps me think 
            of alternative solutions to problems by kind of taking a step back and analysing the situation. 
            
            Another strength I believe I have is my honesty. This is a hard one because honesty can be painful. But I think being honest 
            especially when it comes to critiquing someone’s work is vital for them to maximise their potential. 
            
            Something I struggle with is self-doubt. Seeing people who are highly skilled at something can make me doubt my own abilities, 
            I really would love to stop this thinking and become more comfortable with not knowing everything. I think this ties in with the 
            “growth mindset”. 
            
            I don’t consider myself an optimist, I see myself as more of a realist. I analyse situations like I mentioned before and often 
            forget to be ‘present’ and happy in the moment. I would like to change this and have a more optimistic outlook on life.<br><br>
            
            <b>Workload management</b><br><br>
            To manage my workload in this programme I need to be pushed. Not by someone else but I need a sense of urgency in what I do. 
            The pressure helps to fuel my motivation. To work with this, I will continue writing daily goals and if I achieve them I will 
            make them bigger, and If I don’t I will try to find out why. The goals help me to stay motivated and productive. I am also very 
            driven to become a developer, It has been my long term goal for a number of years now. 
            
            To seek help I will try to communicate with my cohort as much as possible, I think with a collective mind we can all help each 
            other. 
            
            I expect timely responses from the facilitation team. Also I expect them to ask me questions when I am stuck to help my problem 
            solving skills.
            
            I currently have no other commitments for the duration of my time at EDA. But I will take breaks If I mentally feel the need to
