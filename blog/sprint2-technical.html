        <p class="blog-content">
          When you first start to play around with CSS you will come to understand that everything (text, images, all content)
          has a box around it. You may not see this box at first, but you will soon praise this box.<br><br>
          This ‘box’ is made up of a few different things…
        </p>
        <h3 class="small-header">1. The Content</h3>
        <p class="blog-content">
          The content is whatever it is you inserted in your HTML. It could be some text saying “Hello world” or maybe an image of a gazebo.
          This content can be sized with the width and height properties.
        </p>
        <h3 class="small-header">2. Padding</h3>
        <p class="blog-content">
          The padding is what sits around the content and ‘lets it breathe’. It's an invisible space that is controlled by the padding property in CSS.
        </p>
        <h3 class="small-header">3. Border</h3>
        <p class="blog-content">
          The border is exactly what you think it is, it’s a border that sits around the content AND the padding. Just like padding it can be controlled (sized, styled)
          by using the border property in CSS.
        </p>
        <h3 class="small-header">4. Margin</h3>
        <p class="blog-content">
          The margin is outside everything else we have mentioned. It sits after the border. It wraps together the content, padding, and border in one box and separates
          it from another piece of content or another ‘element’ as we call it in HTML. Just like the padding it's also invisible (whitespace), and it can be controlled
          using the margin property in CSS.
