            <b>What is Emotional Intelligence?</b><br><br>

            Emotional Intelligence EQ or EI is the ability to recognize, understand and manage our own emotions. 
            It means being aware that our emotions affect other people and can drive our behaviour. <br><br>

            <i>“Your EQ is the level of your ability to understand other people, what motivates them and how to work cooperatively
            with them,” Howard Gardner, the influential Harvard theorist.</i><br><br>

            <b>How is it different to IQ?</b><br><br>

            IQ stands for Intelligence Quotient, it is a score represented by taking a standardised test which is made to evaluate your 
            intelligence.  Whereas EQ is about evaluating and controlling one’s emotions. IQ is generally used to determine one’s academic 
            abilities and identify people with very high intelligence. EQ is a better determiner of success in workplaces when used to find 
            good leaders and team players.<br><br>

            <b>Why is it important?</b><br><br>

            EQ is very important because it comes with strong leadership potential in companies, it can drive business leaders and managers 
            to perform very well. People with a high EQ generally achieve more, excel at teamwork and service and take more initiative.
