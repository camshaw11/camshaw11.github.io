            <b>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</b><br><br>
             
            Neuroplasticity is the selective organising of connections between neurons in our brains. By understanding the 
            principles of this it can cause people to become more self-aware of the idea that they are physically capable of 
            building knowledge and changing their brains.<br><br><br><br> 
             
            <b>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</b><br><br>
             
            I think personally the point that resonated with me the most was “practice, practice, practice”. I know it’s very cliche, 
            but the very reason it’s a cliche is because it works. The repetition of an activity is one of the strongest ways to build 
            thicker connections in the brain.<br><br><br><br>
             
             
            <b>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</b><br><br>
             
            Some ways to increase neuroplasticity are putting the information in context. If you can relate the new information to a 
            feeling or a memory, people can see the relationships easier. This then helps with long-term memory storage of material.<br><br> 
             
            Another way is to take micro steps. Break down the task you have and try to work through a piece of it everyday. It could 
            be 5 minutes a day, everyone has 5 minutes spare a day. Then eventually build that up more and more. What you are doing is 
            not only repetition but creating a habit, those connections in your brain will become much stronger in no time.<br><br><br><br>

            This article here <a href=" https://www.marksdailyapple.com/16-ways-to-increase-neuroplasticity-and-why-thats-important/" target="_blank">
                "16 Ways to Increase Neuroplasticity and Why That's Important"</a><br> looks at many different ways to approach neuroplasticity. 
                Some even involving your diet, which I thought was 
            interesting.<br><br><br><br>
    
             
             
            <b>Growth Mindset</b><br><br>
             
            <b>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</b><br><br>
             
            A growth mindset is understanding that abilities and talents can be developed through effort, good teaching and persistence. 
            It is relevant because so many people are closed off to the idea that they can get better at a certain skill.<br><br>
             “I can’t lose weight” or “I can’t gain weight”
            Is something I have heard so often from my friends over the years, and often it is said without them really even trying to make 
            a change. They immediately think that they can’t change. A growth mindset is vital in all aspects of life for people to realise 
            that intelligence and skill is malleable.<br><br><br><br>
             
             
             
            <b>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</b><br><br>
             
            I was surprised about how having a growth mindset relates to more areas than just education. It can be applied to every aspect 
            of life. This changed my outlook on how I should approach other things like exercise, relationships, communication, they are all 
            able to be developed, nothing needs to be fixed!<br><br><br><br>
             
             
            <b>How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?</b><br><br>
             
            I will integrate a growth mindset in my learning journey by asking myself “What can I do better next time?” This question will 
            force me to query my cognitive ability and push me to develop myself.<br><br> Any time I complete a task or even meet a new person I will 
            ask myself <br> “How can I communicate with that person better next time?”.<br> This habit should help to integrate a growth mindset into 
            my lifestyle.<br><br><br><br>

            Nothing could beat Carol Dweck's Ted Talk on "The power of believing that you can improve".<br><br>

            "Carol Dweck researches “growth mindset” — the idea that we can grow our brain's capacity to learn and to solve problems. 
            In this talk, she describes two ways to think about a problem that’s slightly too hard for you to solve. Are you not smart 
            enough to solve it … or have you just not solved it yet? A great introduction to this influential field."<br><br>
